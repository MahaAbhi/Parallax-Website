Parallax In today’s era of low attention spans, you must be innovative to create a truly memorable experience. For web designers, one of the most useful ways to achieve this goal is to utilize the parallax scrolling effect. Well-executed parallax scrolling allows you to create a dynamic web experience for your visitors and showcase content in easily digestible segments. What is parallax scrolling? Parallax scrolling is a computer graphics technique used by web designers to create a faux-3D effect. As users scroll down a webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion. Using parallax scrolling is not a new technique. In the early 1980s, game designers working on Super Mario Bros. used parallax graphics to create a sensation of depth. Today, parallax scrolling has become more of a trend in the web design world—and for good reason. Scrolling is easier than clicking, and a well-designed parallax effect engages users to scroll for more information.
